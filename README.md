CinemApp
========

CinemApp is a social network for cineasts, where users can register new accounts, search for other users and movies, read about the movies and also rate them. The app is written for the iPhone and developed from scratch by me and a friend as part of our bachelor thesis. It's written in Objcetive-C using Xcode. We use TMDb's API and database for movie info and Parse as a database to store user data and activity.
